Hi Mr. Kosek,
So this lab is not done at all. 
As of right now, I have the list with
all of the values. It may or may not delete
entries when double clicked.

The Asynch adapter is also not working right
now (probably bcs I haven't spent enough 
time working on it).

I figured I should at least try for partial credit.


Sorry
Arianna
